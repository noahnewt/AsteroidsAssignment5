#ship=ShipClass,0xRRGGBB  -- loads a ship (child of ShipMind) into the framework with color RRGGBB
#ship=human,0xRRGGBB  -- loads a human-controlled ship into the framework with color RRGGBB. Controled by the arrow keys to move/rotate, space to shoot.
#fps=N -- sets the frames per second to N. The default is 30. The more fps, the more updates per second your ships get. The competition will be run at 30fps.
#period=N -- pauses the game after N seconds
#quit=N -- quits the game after N seconds

#Additional keys:
#q - quit
#p - pause / unpause
#c - clear the period (the game won't pause automatically. If already paused because of the expiration of period, c will clear the period, and p will unpause)
